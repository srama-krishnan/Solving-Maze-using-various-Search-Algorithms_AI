## About the Project
This project provides implementations of multiple algorithms for solving mazes, each with its unique characteristics and use cases. It serves as a resource for learning, experimentation, and comparison of various search and optimization techniques in maze-solving.

## Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms are included in this repository:
1. **A* Algorithm** (`astar.py`): Combines heuristics and path cost to find the optimal path.
2. **Bidirectional Search** (`bidirectional.py`): Searches simultaneously from the start and end points to find the shortest path.
3. **Breadth-First Search** (`breadthfirst.py`): Explores all possible paths level by level.
4. **Depth-First Search** (`depthfirst.py`): Explores one path deeply before backtracking.
5. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** (`dijkstra.py`): Finds the shortest path from a source node using edge weights.
6. **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search** (`iddfs.py`): Combines depth-first and breadth-first searches by limiting search depth.
7. **Simulated Annealing** (`simulatedannealing.py`): Probabilistically optimizes the path using a cooling schedule.
8. **Left Turn Algorithm** (`leftturn.py`): Simple algorithm that follows walls to find a way out.

Additional utilities, such as Fibonacci heaps (`FibonacciHeap.py`) and priority queues (`priority_queue.py`), are included to enhance algorithm performance.
